This repository contains some of the programs that I have written for my job at BYU Online. Here is a summary of each one.
- Binary Text Classification with Logistic Regression.py is a file where I trained 10 different classification machine learning models. 
- Find Cutoff Vals and Evaluate Predictions.Rmd finds the optimal cutoff value to consider in order to find the best accuracy and false positive rate.
- Check for Surveys.py uses an API to scan through Canvas to create a report of needed actions regarding various survey pages.
- Alter Surveys in Canvas.py also uses an API to make various needed changes according to the report in Check for Surveys.py

I hope that you enjoy reviewing my code!
